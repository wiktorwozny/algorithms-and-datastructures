# algorithms-and-datastructures

This repository contains many solutions for algorythmic problems, mainly from those three fields:

    <a href="https://github.com/wiktorwozny/algorithms-and-datastructures/tree/main/graphs">graph algorithms</a>
  </li>
</ol>

The repository has a sentimental value for me because every task has been written during Algorithms and Data Structures course on AGH University,
which means in this repo you can watch my first struggle with coding. Unluckily, I did not keep explanations of most of the task.
